== Welcome on the next development site of Tangara ==

Please have a look on the project page at http://tangara.colombbus.org to get more information about this educational IDE.

The current step contains the following task:
* to move the code from our internal SVN to github,
* remove hardcoded and commited dependencies,
* rebuild the build procedure
* refactor the offline help engine (bye bye javahelp, welcome embedded jetty)
==build procedure==
Build procedure is described in [[https://github.com/colombbus/tangara/wiki/Build-environment| build environment page]].
